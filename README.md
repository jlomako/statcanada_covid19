Quebec was the province most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Here, R tidyverse packages are used to explore death counts and excess mortality rate in Quebec.
Raw data was downloaded from Statistics Canada. 
* Quebec and Canada were compared in terms of weekly death rates for the years 2010 to 2020
([Fig 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlomako/statcanada_covid19/master/Fig%201.png)). 
* Quebecs average death rate was calculated and compared to the deaths reported in 2020 
([Fig 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlomako/statcanada_covid19/master/Fig%202.png)). 
* The number of total excess deaths in Quebec during the pandemic in 2020 was calculated. Around 6.700 more deaths than expected were reported between January and December 2020.
